# Quizzler â€“ A Simple True/False Quiz App

Quizzler is a Flutter-based mobile quiz application where users answer **True** or **False**
questions and get instant feedback via icons that show whether each answer was correct or
incorrect.  
Itâ€™s a beginner-friendly Flutter project designed to practice **state management**, **user
interaction handling**, and **basic UI layout**.

## Features

- ðŸ“‹ Multiple questions with True/False answers
- âœ… Instant feedback with a row of green âœ” and red âœ– icons
- ðŸ“± Responsive layout using `Expanded` and `SafeArea`
- ðŸŽ¨ Custom styling with colored buttons for True and False
- ðŸ›  Built entirely with Flutterâ€™s core widgets (no external UI libraries)

---

## How It Works

1. A question is displayed at the top of the screen.
2. The user taps **True** or **False**.
3. If the answer is correct, a green âœ” icon is added to the score row; if incorrect, a red âœ– icon is
   added.
4. The app automatically moves to the next question.
5. When the quiz reaches the end, the app can be extended to show a completion message or restart
   option.
